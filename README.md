# DEVNET-2073

This repository will be used for the Cisco Live Berlin DEVNET-2073 session

Software included: Spark APIs, CMX APIs, APIC-EM APIs, {Spark:Connect} full lab code.

We will use Spark and DevNet Sandboxes for APIC-EM and CMX


A small number of APIs requests will create a new application to enable on-demand Wi-Fi guest networks.

We will interact with Spark’s easy to use APIs to read room messages, and with CMX to locate users of our
Application in the Enterprise network.
APIC-EM device inventory accessed through APIs will identify the Wireless LAN Controllers.

The Prime Infrastructure WLAN configuration APIs will ensure configuration will only be deployed
to the user’s physical location.

Simple script changes could create Hotspot networks based on schedule, incident response or social events.
